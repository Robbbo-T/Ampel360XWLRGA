- **Takeoff Condition:** Cd = 0.035

### Quantitative Data
The following table summarizes the key quantitative data from the simulations:

| Parameter          | Cruise Condition | Takeoff Condition |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Inlet Velocity (m/s)| 250              | 100               |
| Drag Coefficient (Cd)| 0.025            | 0.035             |
| Maximum Pressure (Pa)| 120000           | 110000            |
| Minimum Pressure (Pa)| 95000            | 90000             |

### Uncertainty Analysis
An uncertainty analysis was performed to assess the reliability of the simulation results. The primary sources of uncertainty include mesh quality, turbulence model selection, and boundary condition assumptions. The overall uncertainty is estimated to be ±5%.

## 4. Analysis and Discussion

### Interpretation of the Results
The pressure contours and velocity streamlines indicate that the tail cone design performs well under both cruise and takeoff conditions. The drag coefficient values are within acceptable limits, suggesting that the design is aerodynamically efficient.

### Comparison with Theoretical Predictions
The simulation results were compared with theoretical predictions and experimental data from wind tunnel tests. The drag coefficient values are consistent with the theoretical predictions, validating the accuracy of the simulations.

### Identification of Critical Areas
The simulations identified a few critical areas where flow separation occurs, leading to increased drag. These areas will be targeted for design improvements to enhance aerodynamic performance.

### Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate how variations in input parameters affect the simulation results. The analysis showed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to changes in inlet velocity and turbulence model parameters.

## 5. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Summary of Key Findings
- The tail cone design demonstrates good aerodynamic performance under both cruise and takeoff conditions.
- The drag coefficient values are within acceptable limits, indicating efficient design.
