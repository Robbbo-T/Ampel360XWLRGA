## **Summary**

This **Initial Fuselage Structural Inspection and Maintenance** plan ensures that every section of the fuselage—nose, forward, central, belly, tail cone, APU compartment, along with doors and windows—undergoes **systematic validation** and **preventive maintenance**. By combining **advanced NDT methods**, **digital twin modeling**, **FTCode-based traceability**, and **S1000D** documentation, it promotes a **data-driven**, **continuous improvement** approach.  

As the project evolves:
1. **Update** acceptance thresholds or repair criteria based on field data.  
2. **Integrate** further AI or IoT sensors for real-time fuselage health monitoring.  
3. **Refine** the digital twin with in-service data to enhance predictive maintenance.

**Key**: Maintaining a **closed-loop** system of **inspection**, **repair**, **documentation**, and **analysis** will help ensure **long-term structural integrity**, regulatory compliance, and passenger safety for the **AMPEL360XWLRGA** or any next-generation fuselage design.
