  - Patent filings & IP protection mechanisms (European Patent Office, USPTO, WIPO).
  - Creative Commons or Open Source Licensing with Commercial Restrictions (e.g., OpenAI’s approach to monetizing open research).
  - Revenue-sharing agreements with corporate adopters (percentage-based licensing on technology integration).

### 2. Implement a Corporate Audit & Attribution System
- **Develop an AI-powered tracing system that:**
  - Maps corporate usage of GAIA AIR, ChatQuantum, and other repositories.
  - Detects citation gaps in published research, corporate whitepapers, and aerospace documentation.
  - Flags instances of commercial integration without licensing.

### 3. Engage in Legal & Diplomatic Resolution
- **Engage directly with corporations & institutions through:**
  - Strategic outreach and demand for licensing negotiations.
  - Filing of claims where intellectual contributions have been monetized without fair attribution.
  - Collaboration models where institutions can formalize recognition through shared projects, research grants, and advisory roles.
