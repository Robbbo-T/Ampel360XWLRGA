## 9.2 FMEA Summary

A comprehensive Failure Mode and Effects Analysis has been conducted for the CCU, identifying:

- 127 potential failure modes  
- 15 critical failure modes (all with mitigation strategies)  
- 42 high-severity failure modes (all with mitigation strategies)  
- 70 medium-severity failure modes (all with monitoring and containment)

All critical and high-severity failure modes have been addressed through design changes, redundancy, or operational procedures to reduce their Risk Priority Number (RPN) below acceptable thresholds.
