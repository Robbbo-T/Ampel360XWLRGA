### 2.1 System Description

The Environmental Remediation System (ERS) is an integrated suite of technologies designed to actively remove more pollutants from the atmosphere than the aircraft produces during operation. The system combines advanced carbon capture, atmospheric purification, and catalytic conversion technologies to achieve a net-positive environmental impact.

### 2.2 Key Components

The ERS consists of four primary subsystems:

1. **Carbon Capture System (CCS)** - Captures CO₂ directly from ambient air during flight
2. **Atmospheric Purification Unit (APU)** - Removes particulate matter and other pollutants
3. **Advanced Catalytic Converters (ACCS)** - Neutralizes NOx and other gaseous pollutants
4. **Environmental Monitoring System (EMS)** - Tracks and verifies environmental performance
