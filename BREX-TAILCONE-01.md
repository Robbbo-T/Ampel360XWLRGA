### Category: Manufacturing Processes

#### Rule ID: BREX-TAILCONE-MFG-001
- **Description:** The tail cone components must be manufactured using automated fiber placement (AFP) technology.
- **Rationale:** To ensure precision and repeatability in the manufacturing process.
- **Data Elements:** Manufacturing method, machine settings, quality control parameters.
- **Constraints:** AFP machine settings must be within the specified ranges for speed, pressure, and temperature.
- **Examples:** The AFP machine must operate at a speed of 50 mm/s, a pressure of 5 bar, and a temperature of 120°C.

### Category: Q-01 Integration

#### Rule ID: BREX-TAILCONE-Q01-001
- **Description:** The tail cone design must accommodate the integration of the Q-01 propulsion system.
- **Rationale:** To ensure seamless integration and optimal performance of the propulsion system.
- **Data Elements:** Interface dimensions, mounting points, electrical connections.
- **Constraints:** Interface dimensions must be within ±0.2 mm of the specified values, and electrical connections must meet the specified standards.
- **Examples:** The mounting points for the Q-01 system must be positioned within ±0.2 mm of the specified locations, and the electrical connections must comply with MIL-STD-1553.

## 3. Data Model

### Definition of the Data Model
The data model used to represent the business rules is based on a hierarchical structure, with categories, rules, and data elements. Each rule is uniquely identified by a rule ID and includes a description, rationale, data elements, constraints, and examples.

## 4. BREX Validation

### Description of the Validation Process
The validation process for the BREX data involves the following steps:
1. **Rule Definition:** Clearly define each business rule, including its description, rationale, data elements, constraints, and examples.
2. **Data Collection:** Collect the necessary data elements for each rule from relevant sources, such as design documents, manufacturing records, and quality control reports.
3. **Rule Application:** Apply the business rules to the tail cone design and manufacturing processes, ensuring compliance with the specified constraints.
4. **Verification:** Verify that the applied rules meet the intended objectives and do not conflict with other rules or requirements.
5. **Documentation:** Document the validation process and results, including any deviations or exceptions.

## 6. Comprehensive Requirements Tracking System

### Requirements Tracking System

To ensure a comprehensive, verifiable, and traceable system to document requirements, we have established a digital requirements management platform. This platform uses unique IDs to link design, implementation, and validation tests, ensuring traceability and compliance.

#### Requirements Table

| **Requirement ID** | **Description**                           | **Source** | **Related Test Cases** | **Compliance Status** | **Traceability** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| REQ-001            | Propulsion system must provide ≥ 1000 kN thrust | Design Spec | TC-001                 | Compliant              | Design → Test    |
| REQ-002            | Propulsion system efficiency must be ≥ 95% | Design Spec | TC-001                 | Compliant              | Design → Test    |
| REQ-010            | Emergency exits must deploy within 5 seconds | Safety Req | TC-002                 | Compliant              | Design → Test    |
| REQ-011            | Emergency exit mechanisms must function without failure | Safety Req | TC-002                 | Compliant              | Design → Test    |
| REQ-015            | Flight Control Software must respond within 100 ms | Performance Req | TC-003                 | Compliant              | Design → Test    |

### Evidence Based Data

To ensure data integrity and traceability, all data used for verification must specify its origin and reference the process chain stages it has undergone. This includes raw data, transformation by model results, and verification steps using testing standards.

#### Data Workflow Mapping

Create architectural diagrams showing data flow, including every data manipulation step, linking data between the digital process system, test output, and human processes. This will help visualize how the database fits into the existing ecosystem.

### Traceable Test Cases Generation from Requirements

Every requirement must have a link with a test or method to generate that measurement or evaluation. This ensures that every component in the system points to a section with real parameters where the specification must reach a specific quantifiable level.

#### Linking Method

Create a specific code template linking requirement IDs with validation step sections, including all process, procedures, and test outcome-related parameters. This ensures verifiability for audit purposes and helps create automated verification or software testing tools for automated validations.
