**Document ID:** BREX-TAILCONE-01
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** [Date]
**Author:** [Author Name/Team]

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BREX Document
The purpose of this document is to define the business rules for the tail cone design of the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft. These rules ensure consistency, compliance, and quality in the design, manufacturing, and integration processes.

### Scope of the Business Rules
The business rules outlined in this document apply to the tail cone section of the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft. They cover material selection, geometry constraints, manufacturing processes, and integration with the Q-01 propulsion system.

### Intended Audience
This document is intended for design engineers, manufacturing teams, quality assurance personnel, and regulatory compliance officers involved in the AMPEL360XWLRGA project.

## 2. Business Rules

### Category: Material Selection

#### Rule ID: BREX-TAILCONE-MAT-001
- **Description:** All CFRP components in the tail cone structure must use prepreg material with the specified fiber orientation.
- **Rationale:** To ensure consistent material properties and structural integrity.
- **Data Elements:** Material type, fiber orientation, ply thickness.
- **Constraints:** Fiber orientation must be within ±1 degree of the specified layup schedule.
- **Examples:** CFRP panels must be manufactured using T700 carbon fiber prepreg with an epoxy resin system, following the layup schedule defined in GPAM-AMPEL-0201-53-CFRP-0102-002.

### Category: Geometry Constraints

#### Rule ID: BREX-TAILCONE-GEO-001
- **Description:** The tail cone geometry must adhere to the specified dimensions and tolerances.
- **Rationale:** To ensure proper fit and aerodynamic performance.
- **Data Elements:** Dimensions, tolerances, surface finish.
- **Constraints:** Dimensions must be within ±0.5 mm of the specified values.
- **Examples:** The tail cone length must be 1500 mm ±0.5 mm, and the surface finish must have a roughness value of Ra ≤ 0.8 µm.

### Category: Manufacturing Processes

#### Rule ID: BREX-TAILCONE-MFG-001
- **Description:** The tail cone components must be manufactured using automated fiber placement (AFP) technology.
- **Rationale:** To ensure precision and repeatability in the manufacturing process.
- **Data Elements:** Manufacturing method, machine settings, quality control parameters.
- **Constraints:** AFP machine settings must be within the specified ranges for speed, pressure, and temperature.
- **Examples:** The AFP machine must operate at a speed of 50 mm/s, a pressure of 5 bar, and a temperature of 120°C.

### Category: Q-01 Integration

#### Rule ID: BREX-TAILCONE-Q01-001
- **Description:** The tail cone design must accommodate the integration of the Q-01 propulsion system.
- **Rationale:** To ensure seamless integration and optimal performance of the propulsion system.
- **Data Elements:** Interface dimensions, mounting points, electrical connections.
- **Constraints:** Interface dimensions must be within ±0.2 mm of the specified values, and electrical connections must meet the specified standards.
- **Examples:** The mounting points for the Q-01 system must be positioned within ±0.2 mm of the specified locations, and the electrical connections must comply with MIL-STD-1553.

## 3. Data Model

### Definition of the Data Model
The data model used to represent the business rules is based on a hierarchical structure, with categories, rules, and data elements. Each rule is uniquely identified by a rule ID and includes a description, rationale, data elements, constraints, and examples.

## 4. BREX Validation

### Description of the Validation Process
The validation process for the BREX data involves the following steps:
1. **Rule Definition:** Clearly define each business rule, including its description, rationale, data elements, constraints, and examples.
2. **Data Collection:** Collect the necessary data elements for each rule from relevant sources, such as design documents, manufacturing records, and quality control reports.
3. **Rule Application:** Apply the business rules to the tail cone design and manufacturing processes, ensuring compliance with the specified constraints.
4. **Verification:** Verify that the applied rules meet the intended objectives and do not conflict with other rules or requirements.
5. **Documentation:** Document the validation process and results, including any deviations or exceptions.
