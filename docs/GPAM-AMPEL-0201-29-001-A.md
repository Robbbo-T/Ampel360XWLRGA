### 2.1 Overview
In aerospace or industrial systems, **hydraulic pumps** have critical functions. A failure can create high risks, such as loss of control or high downtime costs. An **AI-driven predictive failure model** provides:
- **Higher reliability** because of early fault detection  
- **Less downtime** because of predictive maintenance

2. Perform feature engineering (FFT for vibration, temperature peaks)  
3. Train the model on failure/non-failure data  
4. Detect anomalies outside normal operating behavior  
5. Predict failure probability (e.g., “Pump A has an 87% chance of failure within 30 operating hours”)

#### D. Predictive Maintenance Integration

## 7. Example Code: Basic Predictive Model (Random Forest)

Below is example Python code showing how to create a **simple predictive model** using synthetic sensor data. In production, replace the fake data with actual sensor readings (pressure, temperature, vibration, and so on):

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# 1. Generate Synthetic Data
np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 5000

pressure = np.random.normal(18.0, 1.0, num_samples)  # in MPa
temperature = np.random.normal(60.0, 5.0, num_samples)  # in °C
vibration = np.random.normal(0.02, 0.01, num_samples)  # in g
flow_rate = np.random.normal(75.0, 5.0, num_samples)  # in L/min
current_draw = np.random.normal(15.0, 2.0, num_samples)  # in A

labels = []
for i in range(num_samples):
    if (pressure[i] < 17.0 or pressure[i] > 20.0 or
        temperature[i] > 70.0 or vibration[i] > 0.03 or
        flow_rate[i] < 68.0 or flow_rate[i] > 82.0 or
        current_draw[i] > 18.0):
        labels.append(1)
    else:
        labels.append(0)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'pressure': pressure,
    'temperature': temperature,
    'vibration': vibration,
    'flow_rate': flow_rate,
    'current_draw': current_draw,
    'failure_label': labels
})

# 2. Train/Test Split
X = df.drop('failure_label', axis=1)
y = df['failure_label']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# 3. Train the Random Forest
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 4. Evaluate
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# 5. Predict Failure Probability
new_sample = np.array([[19.0, 65.0, 0.025, 73.0, 16.0]])
failure_probability = rf_model.predict_proba(new_sample)[0][1]
print(f"\nFailure Probability: {failure_probability:.2%}")
```

### Interpretation and Next Steps
1. **Use Real Data:** Replace synthetic data with real operational data from pumps.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Analyze vibration frequencies or other advanced signals.  
3. **Edge Deployment:** Convert the model to ONNX or TensorFlow Lite for local devices.  
4. **Digital Twin Approach:** Combine real data with simulated scenarios for robust detection.

## 9. Best Practices and Next Steps

1. **Set Data Module Codes:** Follow your CSDB rules.  
2. **Integrate into S1000D Publications:** Or use an Interactive Electronic Technical Publication (IETP).  
3. **Link to Maintenance Tasks:** Cross-reference with AMM procedures (e.g., Chapter 29).  
4. **Version Control:** Update data modules when the AI model changes.  
5. **Adapt to ATA iSpec 2200:** If you need older or different aerospace specs.

## Conclusion

This single **markdown** document describes:
- **Hydraulic pump specs** and lifecycle steps  
- An **AI-driven predictive model** for maintenance (including code samples and best practices)  
- A **S1000D example** for formal documentation in aerospace

With **predictive AI**, organizations can:
- **Reduce unexpected failures**  
- **Cut maintenance costs**  
- **Improve operational safety**

To implement successfully, gather real sensor data, validate the model (testing, digital twin, synthetic data), and adopt official documentation practices (S1000D or ATA). Then maintain continuous learning (federated AI) to keep the model current with real-world conditions.
