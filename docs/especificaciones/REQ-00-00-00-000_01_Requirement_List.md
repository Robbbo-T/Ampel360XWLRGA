        - Tracking the status of V&V activities using the V&V Management Dashboard (VV-DASHBOARD-MGMT-001).
        - Linking test results to specific requirements, ensuring traceability using the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM), as per the Requirements Traceability Management Plan (REQ-PLAN-TRACEABILITY-MGMT-001).

    acceptance_criteria: >
      Implement enhanced cybersecurity measures beyond DO-326A/ED-202A compliance, incorporating the following, as detailed in the Cybersecurity Plan (CYBER-PLAN-001):
          - Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): Implement an IPS to actively block malicious network traffic and attacks, with IPS performance criteria defined in the IPS Performance Specification (CYBER-SPEC-IPS-PERFORMANCE-001).
          - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):  Deploy a SIEM system for real-time security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response, with SIEM system requirements defined in the SIEM System Specification (CYBER-SPEC-SIEM-SYSTEM-001).
          - Advanced Malware Protection (AMP): Implement AMP solutions on critical systems to detect and prevent advanced malware threats, with AMP effectiveness criteria defined in the AMP Effectiveness Specification (CYBER-SPEC-AMP-EFFECTIVENESS-001).
          - Regular Vulnerability Scanning: Conduct automated vulnerability scans of all systems and networks on a weekly basis, as per the Vulnerability Scanning Procedure (CYBER-PROC-VULN-SCAN-001).
          - Red Team/Blue Team Exercises:  Conduct periodic Red Team/Blue Team exercises to simulate cyberattacks and test the effectiveness of security controls and incident response procedures, as defined in the Red Team/Blue Team Exercise Plan (CYBER-PLAN-REDTEAM-BLUETEAM-001).
          - Zero Trust Architecture:  Implement a Zero Trust security model, verifying every user and device before granting access to resources, as per the Zero Trust Architecture Design Document (CYBER-DESIGN-ZEROTRUST-001).
        Cybersecurity hardening measures shall be documented in the Cybersecurity Plan (CYBER-PLAN-001).
        All measures will be tested and in place prior to Initial Operational Capability (IOC), as verified by the Cybersecurity Verification Plan (CYBER-PLAN-VERIFICATION-001).
