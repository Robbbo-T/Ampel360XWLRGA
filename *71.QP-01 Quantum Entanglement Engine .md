**Diagram Highlights:**

- **Particle Flow:** Demonstrates the path from **Particle Source** → **Photon Generator** → **Nonlinear Crystal** → **Entanglement Chamber** → **Focusing & Alignment System** → **Qubit Measurement**.
- **Quantum Control Loops:** Shows **Control Unit** (CU) receiving quantum measurement data, then issuing commands to maintain entanglement and modulate quantum states.
- **Energy Management:** Depicts how power flows from **AEHCS** and **Backup Systems** into the **Energy Conditioning Unit** (ECU) and then out to submodules.
- **Optimization & Diagnostics:** Illustrates the data flow to the **QuantumGenProTerz** algorithm (DAM → OE → CU) and the status reporting to the **Diagnostics & Monitoring System (DMS)**.
- **FADEC Interface:** The **FADECI** node provides two-way communication between Q-01’s Control Unit and the aircraft’s **FADEC**.

---

### **Explanation**

The **Q-01 Quantum Propulsion System** is organized into seven major subgroups, each responsible for critical functions that ensure the generation, maintenance, manipulation, and usage of **entangled particles** to produce thrust. Key points include:

1. **Quantum Entanglement Engine (QEE):**  
   - A chain of submodules (PS → PG → ND → EC → FAS) culminating in stable, high-fidelity entangled particles.

2. **Quantum State Modulator (QSM):**  
   - Receives entangled pairs, measures them (QM), and manipulates their quantum states (QSMMA) under supervision of the CU.

3. **Energy Source and Management:**  
   - Taps into **AEHCS** and backup systems, ensuring stable and conditioned power through the **ECU** and **ESB**.

4. **Thrust Vectoring System (TVS):**  
   - Translates quantum-derived thrust into controlled motion, guided by the **TVSCU**.

5. **QuantumGenProTerz Algorithm:**  
   - Optimizes system performance by analyzing data (DAM) and computing the best control parameters (OE) for the QSM.

6. **Supporting Systems (Cooling & Shielding):**  
   - **Cryogenic Cooling System (CCS)** maintains crucial low temperatures, while **Shielding (SH)** prevents decoherence from external interference.

7. **Control and Interface:**  
   - **FADECI** manages communication with the aircraft’s FADEC, while **DMS** gathers real-time data for monitoring and diagnostics.

This breakdown ensures each submodule’s purpose, inputs/outputs, and integration points are clearly defined, guiding further development, testing, and maintenance of the **Q-01 Quantum Propulsion System** in advanced aerospace projects.

---

## 71.80 Development Status (Summary)

- **QEE (Entanglement Fidelity):** Currently at ~98.5%, exceeding initial targets.
- **QSM (Modulation Accuracy):** ~99.2% with <1 ns response times.
- **TVS (Vectoring Speed):** Achieved 0.06s actuation, aiming for 0.05s.
- **Energy & Management:** AEHCS integration successful, stable power observed.
- **QuantumGenProTerz Algorithm:** Operational in simulated environment, refining real-time optimization during test flights.
