     **Date Identified:** 2025-07-10  
     **Reported By:** John Doe  
     **Description of Defect:** Misalignment in wing spar installation leading to structural weakness.
    
     ## **Root Cause Analysis**
    
     ### **Methodology:** Five Whys
    
     1. **Why** did the misalignment occur?
        - The installation jig was improperly calibrated.
     2. **Why** was the jig improperly calibrated?
        - Routine calibration was skipped due to time constraints.
     3. **Why** were time constraints causing calibration to be skipped?
        - Increased production demands led to prioritizing speed over quality checks.
     4. **Why** did production demands increase unexpectedly?
        - An unanticipated surge in orders from a key client.
     5. **Why** wasn't the increase in orders anticipated?
        - Lack of effective communication between sales and production planning departments.
    
     ## **Findings**
     - **Root Cause:** Inadequate communication between sales and production planning.
     - **Contributing Factors:** Increased production demands without corresponding updates to quality control procedures.
    
     ## **Corrective Actions**
     1. **Improve Communication Channels:** Establish regular meetings between sales and production planning to anticipate order surges.
     2. **Reinforce Calibration Procedures:** Reinstate mandatory routine calibration checks for all installation jigs.
    
     ## **Preventive Actions**
     1. **Implement Training Programs:** Train production staff on the importance of adhering to calibration schedules.
     2. **Monitor Production Metrics:** Introduce metrics to monitor compliance with quality control procedures.
